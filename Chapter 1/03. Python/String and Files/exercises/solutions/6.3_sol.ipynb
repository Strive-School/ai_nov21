To write such a function, you will start with an empty string, and traverse the characters of the argument one by one. When you encounter a character that is acceptable, you add it to the new string. When it is not acceptable, you add a space to the new string. Note that you can check whether a character is acceptable by simple comparisons, e.g., any lower case letter can be found using the test `if ch >= 'a' and ch <= 'z':`. "
